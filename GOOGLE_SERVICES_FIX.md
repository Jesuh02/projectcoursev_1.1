# Google Play Services and Firebase Integration Troubleshooting

## Issue Identified
The app was experiencing a `SecurityException` related to Google Play Services or Firebase. This error is caused by a mismatch between the application's package name and how FileProvider authorities were configured.

## Root Cause
1. In `build.gradle.kts`, the application ID is set to `com.example.tareamov.service`
2. In `google-services.json`, the registered package name is also `com.example.tareamov.service`
3. In `AndroidManifest.xml`, the FileProvider authorities included:
   ```xml
   android:authorities="${applicationId}.fileprovider;${applicationId}.service.provider;${applicationId}.service.fileprovider"
   ```
   
   Which expanded to:
   ```
   com.example.tareamov.service.fileprovider;com.example.tareamov.service.service.provider;com.example.tareamov.service.service.fileprovider
   ```
   
   This created a conflict because `com.example.tareamov.service.service.provider` does not match the registered package name.

## Fix Applied
The FileProvider authorities in AndroidManifest.xml have been updated to:
```xml
android:authorities="${applicationId}.fileprovider;${applicationId}.provider;com.example.tareamov.fileprovider"
```

This ensures that:
1. The first authority matches the application ID as expected
2. The second authority avoids the duplicate "service" in the package name
3. The third authority provides backward compatibility with any hardcoded references

## Verification
To verify the changes:
1. Run the `VERIFY_GOOGLE_SERVICES.ps1` script (Windows) or `VERIFY_GOOGLE_SERVICES.sh` (Linux/Mac)
2. Check that the application ID matches the Firebase package name
3. Confirm the authorities no longer have duplicate "service" segments

## Future Considerations
If you continue to experience issues with Google Play Services or Firebase:
1. Make sure your Firebase console project matches the package name in `google-services.json`
2. Ensure SHA-1 certificate fingerprints are properly registered in Firebase console if using Google Sign-In
3. Check if your `applicationId` in build.gradle.kts matches the package name in your AndroidManifest.xml
4. Consider updating the Firebase SDK versions if needed
